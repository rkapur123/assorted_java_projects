Rahul KapurRk2749DjikstraTo run the progam compile it, if it doesn’t work compile again sometimes the gui is a bit laggy. Then enter source and destination cities (all managed through the Question class) then press compute. It will run through the djikstra class that is well commented and explained then finally output another gui, that is linked instantiated in the djikstra’s class (it is called the points class). The points class will draw the lines connecting each city from source to destination according to djikstras algorithm and will display the distance in the title of the frame. Do not adjust the size of the window the program does not reconfigure to adjustments in size. Also I used a txt version of the citypairs file because I did not know how to open .dat files.KruskalsKruskal use an edge class and a set class to create sets of edges and occasionally merge or add vertices depending on the kruskals algorithm. The code is well commented with most explanatiom so please refer to it for further details. As far as compiling goes just run the program and the MST should get displayed in a gui window.
